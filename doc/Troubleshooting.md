# Troubleshooting
Are you having trouble getting PyImageJ up and running?
Try the PyImageJ doctor!

```
python -c "import imagej.doctor; imagej.doctor.checkup()"
```

See [The PyImageJ doctor](#the-pyimagej-doctor) below for details.

1. [Known Limitations](#known-limitations)
2. [Debugging Tips](#debugging-tips)
3. [Common Errors](#common-errors)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known Limitations

For technical reasons, there are some aspects of ImageJ and ImageJ2 that cannot
fully work from a Python script:

### The original ImageJ API is limited in headless mode

Normally, the original [ImageJ] does not work headless at all. But thanks
to the [ImageJ Legacy Bridge], most aspects of the original ImageJ work
in [headless mode], including via PyImageJ when initializing with
`imagej.init(mode='headless')`.

That said, there are a couple of major areas of functionality in the original
ImageJ that do not work headless, and therefore do not work headless via
PyImageJ.

#### ROI Manager

ImageJ's [ROI Manager] allows you to work with multiple regions of interest
(ROIs) simultaneously. The `ij.plugin.frame.RoiManager` class is the API for
controlling these features. As one might guess just from its package name,
`ij.plugin.frame.RoiManager` is a `java.awt.Frame`, and therefore cannot be
used headless.

If you need to work with multiple `ij.gui.Roi` objects, one option that works
headless is to group them using an `ij.gui.Overlay`.

#### WindowManager

ImageJ's `ij.WindowManager` class consists of static functions for working with
Java AWT windows, including ImageJ's `ij.gui.ImageWindow`. Each ImageJ image is
an `ij.ImagePlus` linked to a corresponding `ij.gui.ImageWindow`. However, in
headless mode, there are no image windows, because they cannot exist headless.
Therefore, attempts to use the functions of the `WindowManager` will fail, with
functions like `WindowManager.getCurrentWindow()` always returning null.
Unfortunately, ImageJ tracks open images via their windows; therefore, you
cannot know which images have previously been opened while running headless,
nor is there an "active image window" while running headless because _there are
no windows_.

Note that if you are having problems with a `null` or incorrect active image
while **running in `GUI` or `INTERACTIVE` mode (i.e. not `HEADLESS`)**, you
might need to call `ij.py.sync_image(imp)`, where `imp` is the `ij.ImagePlus`
you want to register or update.

### Non-blocking INTERACTIVE mode on macOS

On macOS, the Cocoa event loop needs to be started from the main thread before
any Java-AWT-specific functions can work. And doing so blocks the main thread.
For this reason, PyImageJ includes two graphical modes, `GUI` and
`INTERACTIVE`, with `GUI` blocking the `imagej.init` invocation, and
`INTERACTIVE` returning immediately... but `INTERACTIVE` cannot work on macOS
and is therefore not available, due to this OS-specific limitation.

### Old versions of ImageJ2

PyImageJ uses some functions of ImageJ2 and supporting libraries that are not
available in older versions of ImageJ2. While it may be possible to initialize
an ImageJ2 gateway with an older version of ImageJ2, certain functionality may
not behave as intended, so we advise to use version 2.5.0 or later if possible.

### Starting Python from inside ImageJ

At the time of this writing, in order to use PyImageJ, you must start Python
first, and initialize ImageJ2 from there.

We have plans to make it possible to go the other direction: starting ImageJ2
as usual and then calling Python scripts for the Script Editor. But this
architecture is not complete yet; see
[this forum discussion](https://forum.image.sc/t/fiji-conda/59618/11)
for details.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Debugging Tips

### The PyImageJ doctor

PyImageJ comes equipped with a troubleshooter that you can run to check for
issues with your Python environment:

```python
import imagej.doctor
imagej.doctor.checkup()
```

It is completely standalone, so alternately, you can run the latest version
of the doctor by downloading and running it explicitly:

```shell
curl -fsLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imagej/pyimagej/master/src/imagej/doctor.py
python doctor.py
```

(If you don't have `curl`, use `wget` or download using a web browser.)

### Enabling debug logging

You can enable more verbose output about what is happening internally,
such as which Java dependencies are being installed by jgo.

Add the following to the very beginning of your Python code:

```python
import imagej.doctor
imagej.doctor.debug_to_stderr()
```

Under the hood, this `debug_to_stderr()` call sets the log level to `DEBUG`
for the relevant PyImageJ dependencies, and adds a logging handler that
emits output to the standard error stream.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Common Errors

### Error in "mvn.CMD -B -f pom.xml" dependency:resolve: 1

This indicates a problem running Maven on your system.
Maven is needed to fetch Java libraries from the Internet.

Two common problems are:

* [Could not transfer artifact](#could-not-transfer-artifact).
  You might be behind a firewall.
* [Unable to find valid certification path](#unable-to-find-valid-certification-path).
  Your version of OpenJDK might be too old.

Details on how to address these two scenarios are below.

Or it might be something else, in which case it will require more debugging
effort. Please post [on the forum](https://forum.image.sc/tag/pyimagej) and
include the results of re-running the same `imagej.init` call after:

1. Deleting your `~/.jgo` directory; and
2. [Enabling debug logging](#enabling-debug-logging) by adding:
   ```python
   import imagej.doctor
   imagej.doctor.debug_to_stderr(debug_maven=True)
   ```
   to the top of your script. You can try first without `debug_maven=True`,
   but if you still don't get any useful hints in the output, add the
   `debug_maven=True` so that `mvn` runs with the `-X` flag to provide us
   with the copious amounts of output our bodies crave.

#### Could not transfer artifact

If the debugging output includes notices such as:

```
DEBUG:jgo: [ERROR] Non-resolvable import POM: Could not transfer artifact net.imglib2:imglib2-imglyb:pom:1.0.1 from/to scijava.public (https://maven.scijava.org/content/groups/public): Transfer failed for https://maven.scijava.org/content/groups/public/net/imglib2/imglib2-imglyb/1.0.1/imglib2-imglyb-1.0.1.pom @ line 8, column 29: Connect to maven.scijava.org:443 [maven.scijava.org/144.92.48.199] failed: Connection timed out:
```

This suggests you may be behind a firewall that is preventing Maven from
downloading the necessary components. In this case you have a few options
to try:

1. Tell Java to use your system proxy settings:
   ```
   import os
   os.environ["JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS"] = "-Djava.net.useSystemProxies=true"
   ```

2. Configure your proxy settings manually:
   (replacing `example.com` and `8080` as appropriate)
   ```
   import os
   myhost = "example.com"
   myport = 8080
   os.environ["JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS"] = (
       f"-Dhttp.proxyHost={myhost}"
       + f" -Dhttp.proxyPort={myport}"
       + f" -Dhttps.proxyHost={myhost}"
       + f" -Dhttps.proxyPort={myport}"
   )
   ```

3. Configure your proxy settings
   [through Maven](https://www.baeldung.com/maven-behind-proxy) by editing the
   `<settings>..</settings>` block of your `$HOME/.m2/settings.xml` file:
   ```
   <proxies>
     <proxy>
       <id>Your company proxy</id>
       <active>true</active>
       <protocol>https</protocol>
       <host>example.com</host>
       <port>8080</port>
     </proxy>
   </proxies>
   ```

4. [Initialize with a local `Fiji.app` installation](Initialization.md#from-a-local-installation),
   so that PyImageJ does not need to download anything else from the Internet.
   In this case you will also have to manually download the latest `.jar` files
   for
   [imglib2-unsafe](https://maven.scijava.org/#nexus-search;quick~imglib2-unsafe)
   and
   [imglib2-imglyb](https://maven.scijava.org/#nexus-search;quick~imglib2-imglyb)
   and place them in your local `Fiji.app/jars` directory, as these are
   required for PyImageJ but not part of the standard Fiji distribution.

#### Unable to find valid certification path

If the debugging output includes notices such as:

```
Caused by: sun.security.validator.ValidatorException: PKIX path building failed: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target
    at sun.security.validator.PKIXValidator.doBuild (PKIXValidator.java:397)
    at sun.security.validator.PKIXValidator.engineValidate (PKIXValidator.java:240)
```

This suggests the version of Java being used is too old and contains outdated
certificate information. This behavior has been confirmed with the `openjdk`
installed from the default conda channel (i.e. `conda install openjdk`). Try
using an openjdk from the
[conda-forge channel](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/openjdk) instead.

### I ran a plugin and see an updated image, but the numpy array and dataset are unchanged

This bug can occur in certain circumstances when using original ImageJ plugins
which update a corresponding `ImagePlus`. It can be worked around by calling:

```python
imp = ij.WindowManager.getCurrentImage()
ij.py.sync_image(imp)
```

### The same macro gives different results when run multiple times

This pernicious problem, covered by
[issue #148](https://github.com/imagej/pyimagej/issues/148), has been observed
and documented on [a forum thread](https://forum.image.sc/t/57744). No one has
had time to fully investigate, determine how widespread the problem is, or fix
it. Help wanted!

### Original ImageJ classes not found

If you try to load an original ImageJ class (with package prefix `ij`),
and get a `JavaException: Class not found` error, this is because
the environment was initialized without the original ImageJ included.
See [Initialization.md](Initialization.md).

### Not enough memory

You can increase the memory available to the JVM before starting it.
See [Initialization.md](Initialization.md).

### Python hangs when quitting

It's probably because the JVM is not shutting down cleanly. JPype and scyjava
try their best to shut down the JVM, and PyImageJ does its best to dispose all
ImageJ2 resources when Python wants to shut down. However, in some scenarios
there can still be problems; see
[#153](https://github.com/imagej/pyimagej/issues/153).

You can try calling `ij.dispose()` yourself before quitting Python. If that is
not enough, you can even call `scyjava.jimport('java.lang.System').exit(0)`
(Java exit) or `sys.exit(0)` (Python exit), either of which will immediately
terminate both Java and Python.

### log4j:WARN

With ImageJ2 v2.3.0 and earlier, there is an obnoxious warning at startup:

```
log4j:WARN No appenders could be found for logger (org.bushe.swing.event.EventService).
log4j:WARN Please initialize the log4j system properly.
log4j:WARN See http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/faq.html#noconfig for more info.
```

This can safely be ignored, and will be fixed in the next release of ImageJ2.

### TypeError: No matching overloads

Java has method overloading, whereas Python does not. The JPype library is very
smart about figuring which Java method you intend to call based on the argument
types. But it is not perfect&mdash;see e.g.
[jpype-project/jpype#844](https://github.com/jpype-project/jpype/issues/844).
Therefore, you might encounter an error `TypeError: No matching overloads` when
trying to call certain Java methods in some scenarios. Here is an example:

```python
>>> ij = imagej.init()
>>> ij.op().create()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: No matching overloads found for org.scijava.plugin.PTService.create(), options are:
  public default org.scijava.plugin.SciJavaPlugin org.scijava.plugin.PTService.create(java.lang.Class)
```

Until JPype is improved, you will need to work around the issue case by case.
For example, to avoid the error above with the `create()` method, you can use:

```python
CreateNamespace = imagej.sj.jimport('net.imagej.ops.create.CreateNamespace')
create = ij.op().namespace(CreateNamespace)
```

And then `create` will contain the same object normally accessed via
`ij.op().create()`.

If you are stuck, please post a topic on the
[Image.sc Forum](https://forum.image.sc/).


### `pip install jpype1` fails on Windows

There is a known issue installing with `pip` on Windows with Python 3.10.
Please see
[jpype-project/jpype#1009](https://github.com/jpype-project/jpype/issues/1009).

Until this issue is resolved, we suggest those on Windows either:
* Install with `conda` rather than `pip` (*preferred*).
* Downgrade to Python 3.9.
