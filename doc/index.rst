Welcome to PyImageJ's documentation!
====================================

PyImageJ provides a set of wrapper functions for integration between ImageJ2 and Python.
It also supports the original ImageJ API and data structures.

A major advantage of this approach is the ability to combine ImageJ and ImageJ2 with
other tools available from the Python software ecosystem, including NumPy, SciPy, 
scikit-image, CellProfiler, OpenCV, ITK and many more.
