.. rubric:: More use cases

Here are additional links to some other examples using PyImageJ
in other projects.

* The `pyimagej-dextr`_ repository uses Deep Extreme Cut (DEXTR)
  to generate ImageJ ROIs via PyImageJ.
* `PoreSpy`_, a collection of image analysis
  tools used to extract information from 3D images of porous materials,
  uses some ImageJ filters via PyImageJ.
* Some projects at `LOCI`_ use PyImageJ to invoke
  the `Image Stitching`_ and `SIFT-based image registration`_
  plugins of `Fiji`_, together with deep learning for
  multimodal image registration:

  * `Image registration based on SIFT feature matching`_

  * `Generate pseudo modality via CoMIR for multimodal image registration`_

  * `Non-disruptive collagen characterization in clinical histopathology using cross-modality image synthesis`_

  * `WSISR - Single image super-resolution for whole slide image using convolutional neural networks and self-supervised color normalization`_
