- Create distributed processing workflows
- Handle out-of-core operations efficiently

### 3. Custom Plugin Development
**Concept**: Extending ImageJ functionality from Python
**Based on**: Advanced concepts beyond basic tutorials
**Activities**:
- Write ImageJ2 commands in Python using SciJava parameters
- Create custom ImageJ Ops for specialized algorithms
- Develop reusable components for the ImageJ ecosystem
- Package and distribute Python-based ImageJ extensions

### 4. Advanced Troubleshooting and Optimization
**Concept**: Diagnosing and solving complex issues
**Activities**:
- Profile PyImageJ workflows to identify bottlenecks
- Debug Java-Python interopability issues
- Optimize memory usage for specific workflow patterns
- Handle edge cases in data conversion and type handling
- Resolve version conflicts and dependency issues

### 5. Integration with Advanced Python Ecosystems
**Concept**: Building sophisticated analysis environments
**Activities**:
- Integrate with deep learning frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow)
- Create Dask-based distributed processing pipelines
- Build interactive web applications with PyImageJ backends
- Develop MLOps workflows for image analysis
- Connect to cloud computing and HPC resources

### 6. Cutting-Edge Workflows
**Concept**: Implementing state-of-the-art analysis techniques
**Activities**:
- Implement hybrid CPU/GPU processing workflows
- Integrate modern segmentation algorithms (Cellpose)
- Create real-time analysis pipelines for live imaging
- Develop reproducible analysis environments with containerization
- Build automated quality control and validation systems

## Activity Delivery Guidelines

**Advanced activities should:**

1. **Explain** architectural decisions and trade-offs, not just what to do
2. **Demonstrate** production-ready code with proper error handling and testing
3. **Challenge** with open-ended problems requiring creative solutions

### Activity: Building a Scalable High-Content Screening Pipeline

You'll architect a production system for analyzing thousands of microscopy images with distributed processing and automatic quality control.

This involves optimizing memory usage, implementing fault tolerance, and creating monitoring systems.
