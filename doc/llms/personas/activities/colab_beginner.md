### Sharing and Collaboration
**Concept**: Collaborative research with Colab
**Activities**:
- Sharing notebooks with view/edit permissions
- Understanding revision history and comments
- Publishing to GitHub and other platforms
- Creating shareable links for demonstrations

## Activity Delivery Guidelines

**For Colab beginners, emphasize:**

1. **Explain** why Colab's features are useful for research and learning
2. **Demonstrate** with hands-on examples they can immediately try
3. **Challenge** with practical tasks that combine multiple Colab features

**Example structure:**
```markdown
### Activity: Creating Your First Interactive Analysis

You'll build a simple image analysis tool with interactive controls. This shows how Colab can create user-friendly interfaces for complex analysis.

Interactive forms make it easy to experiment with parameters without editing code.
```

```python
# Demonstration: Interactive image analysis with forms
#@title ðŸ”¬ Interactive Image Analysis { display-mode: "form" }
#@markdown Choose your analysis parameters and run the cell to see results

# Form controls for user input
image_url = "https://imagej.net/images/blobs.gif" #@param {type:"string"}
blur_amount = 2.0 #@param {type:"slider", min:0.5, max:5.0, step:0.5}
threshold_method = "Otsu" #@param ["Otsu", "Mean", "Minimum"]
show_original = True #@param {type:"boolean"}

# Analysis code using the form parameters
import numpy as np
from google.colab import files
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

print(f"ðŸ”„ Processing image: {image_url}")
print(f"ðŸ“Š Blur: {blur_amount}, Threshold: {threshold_method}")

# Simulate image processing (in real analysis, you'd use PyImageJ here)
# Load and process image based on user parameters
original_image = np.random.rand(200, 200)  # Placeholder
processed_image = original_image + np.random.rand(200, 200) * 0.1

# Display results based on user preferences
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2 if show_original else 1, figsize=(12, 6))

if show_original:
    axes[0].imshow(original_image, cmap='gray')
    axes[0].set_title('Original Image')
    axes[0].axis('off')
    
    axes[1].imshow(processed_image, cmap='viridis')
    axes[1].set_title(f'Processed (Blur: {blur_amount})')
    axes[1].axis('off')
else:
    axes.imshow(processed_image, cmap='viridis')
    axes.set_title(f'Processed (Blur: {blur_amount})')
    axes.axis('off')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

print("âœ… Analysis complete! Try changing parameters above and running again.")
```

```python
# Challenge: Build your own interactive tool
#@title ðŸŽ¯ Your Interactive Tool { display-mode: "form" }
#@markdown Create a form-based tool for your own analysis

# TODO: Add form parameters for your analysis
# Use different parameter types: string, slider, dropdown, boolean
analysis_type = "Basic" #@param ["Basic", "Advanced", "Custom"]
# Add more parameters here

# TODO: Write analysis code that uses your parameters
def your_analysis_function(param1, param2):
    # Your analysis code here
    pass

# TODO: Display results in a clear, visual way
# Consider using plots, tables, or text summaries

# TODO: Add helpful output messages for users
print("ðŸ’¡ Tip: Change the parameters above and re-run to see different results!")
```
