# PyImageJ Intermediate Activities

For users with some PyImageJ experience, focus on building workflows, handling diverse data types, and integrating with the broader Python ecosystem.

## Key Learning Goals
- Building multi-step image analysis workflows
- Working with complex data types (3D, time series, multi-channel)
- Data conversion between Python and Java ecosystems
- Using ImageJ plugins and macros from Python
- Understanding when to use different ImageJ components
- Debugging skills and performance optimization
- Integration with the broader scientific Python ecosystem
- Real-world research applications and scenarios

## Suggested Activity Topics

### Advanced Data Conversion
**Concept**: Mastering Python-Java data exchange
**Activities**:
- Convert complex numpy arrays to ImageJ (multi-dimensional, different dtypes)
- Work with xarray and other scientific Python data structures
- Handle metadata preservation during conversion
- Optimize conversion performance for large datasets

### Building Analysis Workflows
**Concept**: Chaining operations and managing intermediate results
**Activities**:
- Create multi-step image processing pipelines
- Manage intermediate results and debugging workflows
- Apply operations to batches of images
- Combine PyImageJ with pandas for results management

### Working with Plugins and Macros
**Concept**: Leveraging ImageJ's ecosystem from Python
**Activities**:
- Run ImageJ macros from Python with parameter passing
- Use popular ImageJ plugins (e.g., Bio-Formats, Trainable Weka Segmentation)
- Convert ImageJ macro workflows to PyImageJ Python code
- Handle plugin-specific data formats and requirements

### Command Discovery and Execution
**Concept**: Finding and using ImageJ commands programmatically
**Activities**:
- Search for available ImageJ commands
- Execute commands with proper parameter handling
- Understand command vs. plugin vs. script differences
- Build dynamic workflows based on available functionality

### Working with Bio-Formats and Complex Files
**Concept**: Handling research-grade microscopy data
**Activities**:
- Configure Bio-Formats import options
- Handle multi-series, multi-timepoint datasets
- Extract and work with image metadata
- Manage large file formats efficiently

### ImageJ Ops Integration
**Concept**: Using ImageJ's standardized operations
**Activities**:
- Discover and use ImageJ Ops
- Understand Ops parameters and type requirements
- Combine Ops into analysis pipelines

## Activity Delivery Guidelines

**Intermediate activities should:**

1. **Explain** the broader context and when you'd use these techniques in research
2. **Demonstrate** complete workflows, not just isolated functions
3. **Challenge** with realistic scenarios requiring problem-solving

### Activity: Building a Cell Analysis Pipeline

You'll create a complete workflow to segment cells and measure their properties. This type of analysis is common in cell biology research.

We'll combine image preprocessing, segmentation, and measurement in a single pipeline.
```

```python
# Demonstration: Complete cell analysis workflow
def analyze_cells(image_path):
    # Load image
    image = ij.io().open(image_path)
    
    # Preprocessing pipeline
    blurred = ij.op().filter().gauss(image, 2.0)
    binary = ij.op().threshold().otsu(blurred)
    
    # Segmentation
    labeled = ij.op().labeling().cca(binary, ij.op().labeling().cca.connectedness.FOUR_CONNECTED)
    
    # Measurements
    results = []
    for label in range(1, labeled.max() + 1):
        area = ij.op().geom().size(labeled == label).getRealDouble()
        results.append({'label': label, 'area': area})
    
    return results

# Run on sample data
results = analyze_cells('https://imagej.net/images/blobs.gif')
print(f"Found {len(results)} objects")
```

```python
# Challenge: Extend the pipeline for time-series analysis
def analyze_cell_movie(image_path):
    # TODO: Load a time-series image
    movie = # Your code here
    
    # TODO: Process each timepoint and track changes
    timepoint_results = []
    for t in range(movie.dimension(movie.dimensionIndex('Time'))):
        # Extract timepoint
        timepoint = # Your code here
        
        # Analyze cells at this timepoint
        cells = analyze_cells(timepoint)
        timepoint_results.append({'time': t, 'cell_count': len(cells)})
    
    return timepoint_results
```
