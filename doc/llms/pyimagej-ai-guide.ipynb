    "## üìù Notes on Google Colab\n",
    "Colab is fundamentally a non-reproducible environment:\n",
    "- We do not have control over what is installed in the base environment\n",
    "- We cannot even control the Python version that is installed\n",
    "- ‚ùóWe **strongly recommend against** publishing workflows that must run in Colab for these reasons‚ùó\n",
    "\n",
    "However, Colab is a fantastic environment for learning:\n",
    "- No local software installation required\n",
    "- Built-in Gemini AI assistant to generate and troubleshoot your code\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we recommend a new learner in PyImageJ follows this progression:\n",
    "1. First, use this notebook in Colab to *learn* PyImageJ interactively\n",
    "1. Next, learn how to configure local Python environments and run notebooks *locally* and *reproducibly*\n",
    "1. Finally, learn how to run Python code *directly with ImageJ/Fiji*: either through the [Fiji Script Editor](https://imagej.net/scripting/script-editor), or in a traditional Python-first environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this notebook can still be used to *create* workflows that will run in any of these environments, but they do have subtly different requirements. Eventually, we can also use the resources of this notebook to tailor other Large Language Models (LLMs - like Gemini) to assist us in these tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, start with [How to Use This Notebook](#scrollTo=_How_to_Use_This_Notebook)!\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ö†Ô∏è When you first run this notebook, you may see a warning: \"This notebook was not authored by Google\"\n",
    "* This is normal when running notebooks not owned by you or Google\n",
    "* We recommend saving your own version with `File > Save a copy ...` first, as this notebook is intended to be modified!\n",
    "* You can also safely click \"Run anyway\" to proceed"

    "- **Beginner Activities**: Basic image loading, simple operations, understanding the PyImageJ ecosystem\n",
    "- **Intermediate Activities**: Building workflows, combining multiple operations, working with different data types  \n",
    "- **Advanced Activities**: Custom plugin integration, performance optimization, complex analysis pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "Gemini will guide you through activities in a logical progression:\n",
    "1. **Foundation**: Core concepts and basic operations\n",
    "2. **Application**: Practical image analysis tasks\n",
    "3. **Integration**: Combining PyImageJ with other Python tools\n",
    "4. **Mastery**: Advanced techniques and custom development\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Stuck?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the **Gemini button** (<font size=\"5\">‚ú¶</font>) at the top-right of a selected code cell to ask Gemini to explain that code\n",
    "1. If a code cell fails, use the **Explain error** at the bottom of the cell to start troubleshooting with Gemini\n",
    "1. The Gemini assistant does have limitations; asking another LLM, like ChatGPT or Claude, can help (just tell them you're working on a Colab notebook!)\n",
    "1. For tips on effective prompting, see [üß† Getting the Most from AI Assistants](#scrollTo=_Getting_the_most_from_AI_Assistants)\n",
    "1. If you're still stuck, please get in touch on the [Image.sc forum](https://forum.image.sc)!\n",
