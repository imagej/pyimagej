# Production Research Ruleset

## REPRODUCIBILITY FOCUS
- Always include version information (ImageJ, Fiji, PyImageJ)
- Use seed values for any random operations
- Document parameter choices and their rationale
- Save intermediate results for debugging

## CODE QUALITY
- Write modular, reusable functions
- Include proper error handling and validation
- Use type hints and docstrings
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines

## DATA MANAGEMENT
- Implement proper file naming conventions
- Save metadata alongside processed images
- Use structured output formats (CSV, JSON, HDF5)
- Document the complete processing pipeline

## PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION
- Profile code to identify bottlenecks
- Use batch processing for multiple images
- Implement progress tracking for long operations
- Consider memory usage for large datasets

## COLLABORATION SUPPORT
- Write self-documenting code
- Include example usage and test cases
- Provide clear installation and setup instructions
- Use version control best practices
